# Python-Calcultor

For graphics user interface I have used tkinter.


To add an icon to the the program add the following lines of code:
  img=tk.PhotoImage(file='Image file in ".png" format')
  window.iconphoto(False,img)
Also ensure that the image is the same directory as the program.

Apart from doing calculations the program can also convert various weight units.
